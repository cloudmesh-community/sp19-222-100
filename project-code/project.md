# Voting Prediction Simulation

The research question we are atempting to answer is, how would the 115th Congress vote on a hypothetical bill? People who might care about this would be anyone who has interest in their representatives in government. This could also help people see how someone they voted for would potentially vote on a topic or bill of interest to them. The dataset we are using is coming from the Senate website. We downloaded invidual voting records which were then compiled into one dataset. We will also pull information about specific bills to see how senators have voted in the past. At the bottom there is an example code of the data we collected and compiled. The machine learning will try and tackle for each senator to try and learn their voting trends and also processing the bills they have voted on in the past.
