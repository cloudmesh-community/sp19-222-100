# Voting Prediction Simulation

The research question we are atempting to answer is, how would the 115th Congress vote on a hypothetical bill? People who might care about this would be anyone who has interest in their representatives in government. This could also help people see how someone they voted would potentially vote on a topic or bill of interest to them. The data set we are using is coming from the Senate website where we downloaded invidual voting records which were then compiled into one data set. We will also pull information about specific bills to see how senators have voted in the past. At the bottom there is an example code of the data we collected and compiled. The machine learning will try and tackle for each seantor to try and leatn their voting trends and also processing the bills they have voted on in the past.
