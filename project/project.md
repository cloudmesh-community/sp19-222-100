# Voting Prediction Simulation

The research question we are atempting to answer is, how would the 115th Congress vote on a hypothetical bill? People who fall into the category of caring about this would be anyone who has interest in who represents them in the government. This could also help people see how someone they voted for could potentially vote about a topic or bill of intest to them. The data set we are using is coming from the Senate website where we downloaded invidual voting records and then complied into one data set. We will also pull info about specific bills to see how senators have voted in the past. At the bottom there is an example code of the data we collected and compiled. The machine learning will try and tackel for each seantor to try and leatn their voting trends and also processing the bills they have voted on in the past.
